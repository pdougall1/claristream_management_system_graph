# CMS graph
proposal for d3 graph

### Summary
So I kind of went off and did this all day.
It's the slightly more complex graph we need to have.
There is kind of a lot of code here but I hope I've refactored it to be a little more manageable.
Playing with D3 is fun.
A lot of the overhead is more about configuring the data well rather than actually implementing the tool.

### Setup
Just clone the repo and open index.html in your browser :)
You'll see a little demonstration of the interface.  The code that it's going through in in `src/main.js`

### Testing
Just open `spec.html` in the brower.

Yea, well there's a little bit of testing.  There are a few places that could be tested more in the data objects.

### TODO
It would be nice to smooth this out with transitions.  That would be the next step IMO.
